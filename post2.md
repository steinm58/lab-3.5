## The Glow of Lumina

Welcome back space friends! This blog post is all about my adventure to Mystara's moon, Lumina. Mystara has  
one moon and it has this light yellow aura that is just as captivating as the pinks and purples on its planet.  

As soon as our spacecraft landed we were greeted with the warmth this moon has. Lumina is a very warm moon  
that is covered in this fine yellow powder. This powder glows and that is how this moon gives off light. It  
was very fascinating to see in person. On Lumina, there is not very much life, just a few small moon creatures  
that were very shy so we didn't see much of them.

Lumina is also covered in a lot of big craters. There is one main one that we wanted to see, the biggest one on  
the moon. It is a known attraction that was very worth seeing. It is so big that it took us an hour to actually  
walk through it. This usual crowded attraction was not very busy when we went so I would reccomend going during  
the middle of the week.
