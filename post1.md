## Journey to Planet Mystara

Welcome back space friends! Today will be all about my recent adventure to the planet Mystara. With its  
unique pink and purple hues it made for a very interesting visit. This visit was filled with lots of adventure   
and mystery.

After a really long journey through space, we were greeted by the vibrant pink aliens as soon as we landed.   
Luckily, they are friendly so we did not have to worry. When I say everything on this planet is pink and  
purple, I mean EVERYTHING. We were surrounded by the fluffy pink grass that was filled with so many exoctic  
flowers in various shades of, you guessed it, pink and purple.   

On this particular journey, we were most interested in visiting the beautiful cosmic cave systems on Mystara.  
This was a long journey so we had to pack some things from the aliens that would allow us to get through the   
journey. As we trekked through the caves we were delighted to see so many crystals that were so radiant and   
out of this world to look at.

One of the highlights of this particualr journey was the night sky as we made our way back home. The sky was  
filled with so many colors and stars that made is incomparable to the night skies we see back home. We had a  
very busy day on Mystara and I will be returning again in the near future so stay tuned.
